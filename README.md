## Project Details

Yeah Stretching is an online wellness platform that showcases the services of Prof. Yami Sayag. 

Prof. Sayag is an instructor offering classes in Stretching, Pilates Mat, Meditation, and Esferodinamia. 

The website provides a personalized presentation of Prof. Sayag, including a brief description of her history, trainings, and the services she offers. 

It is also designed to promote wellness packages for businesses.

## Technical Details

The website is built using React and React Router, with AOS used to add animations to the page. 

- **React**: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface of the website.
- **React Router**: Used for handling navigation within the site.
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**: A library that allows us to animate elements as they scroll into view.

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **src**: This is where the main source code of the application lives. It contains all the React components and their respective styles.
- **public**: This directory contains the static resources used in the project.
- **dist**: This is the output directory where the production-ready application is built to.

The project uses SCSS as its CSS preprocessor, allowing for more maintainable and scalable stylesheets.
